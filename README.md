# PalindromeChecker
#### Description: First JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project from FreeCodeCamp: Palindrome Checker
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

This project is a palindrome checker. I first removed all non-alphanumeric characters and converted to lowercase. I then split the string into individual characters, reversed those characters, and rejoined them. Finally, I used an if statement to return true if the string matched itself in reverse and an else statement to return false.
