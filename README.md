# PalindromeChecker
#### Description: First JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project from FreeCodeCamp: Palindrome Checker
Instructions:
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

This project shows how effective split(), reverse(), and join() are. They make the solution to the problem very straightforward.
